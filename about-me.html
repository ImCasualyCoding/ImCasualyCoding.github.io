At 20 years old, I am navigating one of the most demanding periods of life: a junior year in college. But for this computer science major, life isn't just about algorithms and data structures. I am crafting a life that balances a rigorous academic workload with a deep commitment to physical fitness, diverse hobbies, and a strong work ethic.

As a third-year student, I am deep in the trenches of my computer science curriculum, currently tackling Python in his classes. The major is known for its intense problem-solving and long hours, laying the groundwork for a future in technology.

But when the books close, I am anything but sedentary. I find a necessary physical outlet through a passion for sports,  playing both basketball and soccer. This love for activity extends to a consistent routine at the gym, ensuring he balances the mental strain of coding with the physical benefits of a healthy lifestyle.

When it's time to unwind, I enjoy another popular pastime: video games. It's a hobby that aligns with my technical interests while providing a a way to connect with friends and decompress from his studies.

My responsible nature extends beyond his schoolwork. At home, I am caretaker for a trio of pet birds, including two budgies and one cockatiel. This sense of diligence also defines his approach to work. To earn money, I alongside my mother built a reliable reputation through my side hustles of dog sitting and house cleaning, demonstrating a level of hustle and accountability that complements my academic ambitions.

At 20, I am trying to be a, well-rounded studentâ€”proving that it's possible to pursue a technical career path while actively investing in one's health, hobbies, and responsibilities.
